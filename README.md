# Vacancy - Convolution Reverb
###### Research for UCSB course **MAT240B**; Winter 2018


## Motivation
Construct an open source plugin for personal education and hopefully for usable reproduciton.

## Goals
- Real-time convolution
- User-defined impulse response
- Interactive filter and ADSR envelope design
- User parameters such as:
  - Pre-delay
  - Time stretch
  - Time reversal
  - etc.
  
 ## Stretch goals
 - Stand-alone application
 - Cross-platform
 
 ## Brainstorming 
 (these feel like they should be separate plugins)
 - Granulation
 - Feedback/distortion
 - Downsampling/bitcrushing
